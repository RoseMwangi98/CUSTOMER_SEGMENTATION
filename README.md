# CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
The aim of this project is to allow a company to perform targeted marketing strategy to various customers,rather than one marketing campaign targeting the whole population.This will also allow them to spot gaps and how to better the products for competitive advantage.
The main aim of setting up a Business is always to make profits. 
These days one can get the information of their customers just from one tap and making them fill surveys on the quality of products they bought and how satisfied they were. Customer satisfaction should be every business ownerâ€™s biggest goal so as to keep them coming back. 
The goal is to find any structures that might be economically interesting from the point of marketing to these clients.
